Here is the link to [eGurjan Academy](http://academy.egurjan.com) beta version in test (https://goo.gl/czBWSd).

### How is it a Game?

- Students will gain coins for watching videos, and can get more points for attempting quizzes.
- If they would like to play refreshment games they would have to invest the coins that they had earned. So, the more they want to play, the more they would have to learn.
- Top 10 Daily Rankers would be displayed on the first page of the site, which would motivate the students to watch the videos.
- It is a game which is not addictive in any sense, and they can challenge their classmates to beat them.
- A game + learning environment, which a student would fall in love to.

We had not used just for a game, but we are preparing an environment which would emphasis more for academic excellence rather than just a game.

### Current Version:

#### Physius
It includes many interesting Physics videos and students are engaged by Quizzes relative to their subjects from class 6 to 10.
